Here, we will be preforming the Hartree-Fock self consistent field method for a water molecule in the cc-pVDZ method. 
This method finds mean field solution to the electronic structure Hamiltonian. 

\section{Load Data}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Load the convergence criteria: the maximum iterations \texttt{data/iteration\_max.txt}, convergence of density matrix \texttt{data/convergence\_DM.txt}, and convergence of the energy \texttt{convergence\_E.txt}. The Hartree-Fock method is an iterative method and these decide when the method has converged. We'll talk more about these below.
\item Load in the integrals. These integrals are the overlap \texttt{data/S.txt}, the kinetic \texttt{data/T.txt}, the nuclear attraction \texttt{data/V.txt}, and the electron repulsion integrals \texttt{data/eri.txt}. These are real-valued integrals over gaussian fucntions.
\item Load in the nuclear repulsion energy \texttt{data/E\_nuc.txt}, the number of electrons alpha \texttt{data/num\_elec\_alpha.txt}, the number of electrons beta \texttt{data/num\_elec\_beta.txt}, and the number of atomic orbitals \texttt{data/num\_ao.txt}.
\end{enumerate}
